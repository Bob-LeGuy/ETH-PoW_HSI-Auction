# ETH-PoW_HSI-Auction
This is a repository to collaborate on &amp; deploy a simple &amp; secure independent WFE to start, bid(limited, expect degraded UX) and end/claim Hedron HSI liquidation auctions
This repo might also be compatible w/ the ETHf Network
Suggestions welcome - I've never created a Github or project before
