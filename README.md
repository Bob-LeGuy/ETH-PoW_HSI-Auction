# ETH-PoW_HSI-Auction
This is a repository to collaborate on & deploy a simple & secure Web Frontend w/ typical wallet integration for Hedron HSI liquidation auctions in order to:

-Open bids on eligible HSIs

-bid (limited, expect slow & degraded UX due to lack of ETHw graph/subgraph database infrastructure) 

-end/claim completed auctions.

This repo might also be compatible w/ the ETHf Network, but the primary objective is ETHw.

Suggestions welcome - I've never created a Github or project before. Thanks for your efforts & advice.
