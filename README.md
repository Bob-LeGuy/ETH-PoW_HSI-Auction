# ETH-PoW_HSI-Auction
This is a repository to collaborate on &amp; deploy a simple &amp; secure WFE for Hedron HSI liquidation auctionsin order to:

-Start

-bid(limited, expect slow degraded UX due to lack of net infrastructure) 

-end/claim completed auctions.

This repo might also be compatible w/ the ETHf Network, but the primary objective is ETHw.

Suggestions welcome - I've never created a Github or project before. Thanks for your efforts & advice.
